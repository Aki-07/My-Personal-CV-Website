      <h3>Machine learning</h3>
      <p class="info">
         As we all know Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed,
         it is the  field of study in which I am in love with ‚ù§‚ù§.
         Overtime I have gained  a very good experience ,working in couple of projects and also have
        completed the mastery course in Data Science and Machine Learning from Udemy.

      <h3>Design and Development</h3>
      <p class="info">
        I started learning to code when I was 13 years old because I wanted to make my own cool webistes
        By doing so I learnt a lot of web designing applications like the html,css, bootstrap,javascript.
        Also I have quite the knowledge to design an website independently.

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p class="info">
        Photography is one of my favourite hobbiesüì∑.
        I will go out with my friends just for taking pictures of authentic scenaries.
        This hobby of mine actually makes me see the beauty of the nature in a different angle.

      <p class="info">
      I have completed a basic course in Pshcology which
      I studied purely based on my interest of ,  what other people would think..
      This sounds little funny üòÇI know.., but having a knowledge in this type of subject has made
      me more confident in communication skills with people in social gatherings
      and also made me understand from a customer or client side needs.
